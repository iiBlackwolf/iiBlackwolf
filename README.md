# About
## Who am i?
Hi, my name is yousef osama, but online I go by the username **WOLF**. I'm a software developer with a passion for creating cool things that people can use and enjoy. My primary focus is on developing Discord bots and game projects and a little on web apps, but I'm always interested in learning and exploring new areas of development.

## What do I do?
I spend most of my time developing software and experimenting with new ideas. Currently, I'm learning Python and some of it's useful librarys and sql, as I believe they are versatile languages that can be used in various fields. I'm also working on developing my skills in frontend development and game development.

## What am I interested in?
As I mentioned earlier, my primary interest lies in node.js projects, games projects and web apps. However, I'm also passionate about exploring new technologies, reading about new advancements in the field of computer science, and participating in tech-related discussions.

## How can you reach me?
If you have any questions or would like to collaborate on a project, feel free to reach out to me on Discord at `WOLF#5414`. I'm always happy to chat with fellow developers and help out in any way I can.
